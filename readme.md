## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on prediticting and analyzing customer churn for a subscription-based service using a publicly available dataset. 
It combines data cleaning, EDA, and Machine Learning to generate actionable insights for reducing churn and imporving customer retention

## Objectives
-   Clean and prepare the dataset
-   Idenity key facotrs contributuing to customer churn
-   Build predictive models to forecast churn risk
-   Generate insights and recommendations for multiple business roles

## 📈 Key Insights
<img src="images/Churn_Correlation_Matrix.png" alt="Churn Correlation Matrix" width="600"/>

-   Month-to-Months customers are 3 times more likely to churn than long term ones
-   Customers without support services (like tech and security) are more likely to churn
- Churn is highest within the first year of service
- Customers paying with electronic check (autopay) churn more than other methods

## Recommendations
- Offering incentives for long-term sign up (large discounts for two year signup when creating contract)
- Bundling support services in tier plans
- Find ways to ease customers in with thier first 12 months
